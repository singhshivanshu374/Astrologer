Astrology Insights is a simple and interactive web application that gives users zodiac-based insights and fun future predictions based on their birth date.

Users just need to enter their name and date of birth. The app calculates their zodiac sign and displays a personalized message, including a prediction and a positive recommendation. For example: “Feed a street dog and spread kindness.”

The UI is clean, centered, and mobile-friendly. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, focusing on DOM manipulation and user interaction.

This was created as a beginner-friendly personal project to practice form handling, conditional rendering, and real-time feedback based on user input.
